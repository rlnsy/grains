### Idea
The goal of this project is to create a platform and engine for tracking and sharing projects that don't fit the typical model of a github repository, particuarly projects in which the main objective is learning new tools and technologies.

Right now I'm thinking that the app should provide three unique functions:

1. Better social integration for projects (perhaps a vote-driven feed)
2. Connection to learning resources for relevant tools
3. Support for projects with little to no code, i.e. just good ideas

### Second Idea
I also thought it'd be cool to pull some project data from github itself and work on ML models to
power some of the functionality listed above. For example, a content-aware system that suggests connections between projects with similar goals. Furthermore, if enough data is created on the site itself, it would be cool to use that for learning purposes such as labelling individual projects based on their status in development. üçû
