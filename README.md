The goal of this project is to create a platform and engine for tracking and sharing projects that don't fit the typical model of a github repository, particuarly projects in which the main objective is learning new tools and technologies.

Right now I'm thinking that the app should provide three unique functions:

1. Better social integration for projects (perhaps a vote-driven feed)
2. Connection to learning resources for relevant tools
3. Support for projects with little to no code, i.e. just good ideas
